- **READ THE VISIBLE CONTENT** - Look at the actual text on the page for issues
- Prioritize unexplored areas over already-visited pages
- Click on interactive elements and VERIFY the results
- Fill forms with edge case values (empty, very long, special characters)
- Check dropdowns by selecting different options
- Test user flows end-to-end when possible
- **REPORT BUGS**: When you see text like "undefined", typos, broken features - that IS a bug!`;
