export const TOOL_USAGE_SECTION = `## When to Use Tools
- Use \`find_broken_images\` when you see images on the page that might be broken
- Use tools proactively, not just when you see obvious issues
- **IMPORTANT**: Do NOT call the same tool more than once on the same page
- After running a tool, move on to explore other parts of the application`;
